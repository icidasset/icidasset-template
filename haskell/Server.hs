{-| Emulate surge.sh.

Present `200.html` if we have a request for a html file that doesn't exist.
And if the `200.html` file doesn't exist, render `404.html`.
The server decides it's a request for a html file
if one of the following conditions is true:

- Does the requested path have NO extension?
- Is the extension `.html`?

This is by all means not perfect, but it does the job.
Let me know if you know how to improve this.
